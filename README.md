This is a legacy port of the morpheus parser, code which originates from the Perseus Digital Library.

The Alpheios version of morpheus differs primarily in that it adds an XML API interface to the output.

This repository includes binary versions of the morpheus code that were built many many years ago and likely do not run on recent versions of the various operating systems. Likewise the makefiles included here are not up to date for recent versions of GCC.

The github workflow file does include build instructions that worked as of 2024. The github workflow file was copied from the Perseids project version of morpheus at https://github.com/perseids-tools/morpheus. That repository may have more up to date makefiles.

The only data in this repository that is still being updated are the stemfiles, for which we welcome pull requests. Contributions of changes to these files that build successfully will be deployed to the Alpheios morphology service for as long as we are able to support that service.

Alpheios is a 501(c)3 non-profit that is fully funded by public contributions and no longer has an active development team.
